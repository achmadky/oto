# 🟣 OTO – Web App

OTO is a lightweight web application that allows users to upload images containing text (like documents, notes, or signs), extract the text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and display the results clearly. Built for simplicity and speed — no login required, no backend database. Just open, upload, and extract.
